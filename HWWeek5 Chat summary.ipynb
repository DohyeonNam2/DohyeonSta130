    "Summary of Our Interactions:\n",

    "Statistical Hypothesis Testing Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by discussing key concepts of statistical hypothesis testing, including the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁), p-values, and how to interpret them.\n",
    "You asked for clarification on how one-tailed and two-tailed tests differ. I explained that one-tailed tests only look for deviations in one direction, while two-tailed tests consider both directions.\n",
    "Assignment on Fisher's Tea Experiment (STA130 Context):\n",
    "\n",
    "You presented the Fisher's Tea Experiment adapted for a sample of 80 STA130 students, with 49 correctly identifying whether tea or milk was poured first.\n",
    "I provided the statistical analysis using a binomial test to determine whether students were performing better than random guessing.\n",
    "Hypothesis and Statistical Test Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): Students are randomly guessing (50% chance of identifying correctly).\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Students are better than random guessing (proportion of correct guesses > 50%).\n",
    "Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided Python code using scipy.stats.binom_test to perform the hypothesis test. The result was a one-tailed p-value of 0.0283, indicating significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "You received a Deprecation Warning since binom_test is deprecated. I updated the code to use the newer binomtest function to avoid the warning and ensure compatibility with future versions of SciPy.\n",
    "Conclusion of the Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the p-value of 0.0283, we concluded that there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning students appear to have some ability to correctly identify which was poured first.\n",
    "Summary for Submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "I provided a clear structure for your report, covering the problem introduction, relationship to Fisher’s original experiment, formal null and alternative hypotheses, quantitative analysis using a binomial test, and conclusions based on the p-value.\n",
    "Key Points from the Interactions:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis: Students are randomly guessing (50% correct).\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis: Students are better than random guessing.\n",
    "Binomial Test: Conducted to check if the proportion of correct guesses is significantly greater than 50%.\n",
    "P-Value: One-tailed p-value of 0.0283, indicating significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Updated Code: Used binomtest for compatibility with future SciPy versions.\n",
    "This summary can be submitted as part of your homework record to demonstrate the step-by-step approach we took in conducting the statistical analysis for the tea experiment."
