    "**Research Question 1: Data Summarization and Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "Variables: Key demographic or outcome variables in the CSCS dataset (ex. age, income level, education, specific scores).\n",
    "Analysis: Summarize measures of central tendency and variability for chosen variables, calculating means, medians, standard deviations, and generating frequency distributions.\n",
    "Possible Results: Could reveal demographic group differences or illustrate score distributions across categories.\n",
    "Relevance: Provides foundational data distribution knowledge, guiding further analysis by identifying patterns and outliers that may need in-depth exploration.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Research Question 2: Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "Variables: Performance metrics or scores by specific subgroups (ex. education level or income bracket).\n",
    "Analysis: Calculate confidence intervals for subgroup means to explore variability, followed by hypothesis testing (ex. t-tests) to assess if differences between subgroups are statistically significant.\n",
    "Possible Results: May indicate significant differences across subgroups, highlighting potential demographic or socioeconomic impacts on performance.\n",
    "Relevance: Helps explore data equity or disparities, relevant for understanding accessibility or outcome-based objectives.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Research Question 3: Simple Linear Regression**\n",
    "Variables: Choose a predictor and outcome variable (ex. income level predicting test scores or academic performance).\n",
    "Analysis: Conduct simple linear regression to examine the relationship between the predictor and outcome. Analyze the regression coefficient and p-value for significance.\n",
    "Possible Results: Potentially reveals significant positive or negative correlations, showing how predictor changes might impact performance.\n",
    "Relevance: Offers insights into potential causal relationships, essential for formulating recommendations or interventions grounded in dataset findings.\n",
